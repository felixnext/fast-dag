# fast-dag Documentation

Welcome to the **fast-dag** documentation! This guide will help you understand and use fast-dag to build powerful, efficient workflows in Python.

## What is fast-dag?

fast-dag is a lightweight, high-performance Python library for building and executing Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and Finite State Machine (FSM) workflows. It's designed to be:

- **Simple**: Intuitive API with decorator-based workflow definition
- **Fast**: Minimal overhead with support for parallel and async execution
- **Flexible**: From simple pipelines to complex state machines
- **Type-Safe**: Full type hints for better IDE support and fewer bugs
- **Extensible**: Easy to add custom behaviors and integrations

## Quick Install

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install fast-dag

# With visualization support
pip install fast-dag[viz]

# With all features
pip install fast-dag[all]
```

## Quick Example

Here's a taste of what fast-dag can do:

```python
from fast_dag import DAG

# Create a workflow
dag = DAG("data_pipeline")

@dag.node
def fetch_data() -> dict:
    return {"sales": [100, 200, 300]}

@dag.node
def process_data(data: dict) -> float:
    return sum(data["sales"]) / len(data["sales"])

@dag.node
def save_result(average: float) -> str:
    return f"Average sales: ${average:.2f}"

# Connect the nodes
dag.connect("fetch_data", "process_data", input="data")
dag.connect("process_data", "save_result", input="average")

# Run it!
result = dag.run()
print(result)  # "Average sales: $200.00"
```

## Why fast-dag?
